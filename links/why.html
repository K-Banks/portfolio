              <p>Programming is becoming more and more ubiquitous across all industries, especially as automation is taking over menial and repetitive tasks. I have experienced this first hand at my previous job where I was able to work with a fairly unique device and tasked with the goal of automated an entire diagnostic test so minimal human interaction and supervision required. I was fortunate to learn some of the logic and thought processes necessary for effective coding from my coworker and mentor in the process so I decided I would like to explore this newfound interest further.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Ultimately, I would like to work my way towards Game Development and break into the industry as gaming has been a passion of mine since I recieved my first Gameboy when I was 5. Picking up programming is an essential skill for development of systems and mechanics without needing to rely upon external tools. My hope is that I will be able to design animal AI systems to further immerse players in virtual environments and be able to bridge my knowledge of biology and ecology with my love for gaming.</p>
